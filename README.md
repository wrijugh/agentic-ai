# agentic-ai
Agentic AI Series of Videos for YouTube

## Intent
The whole intent of this series to tell you all that it is easy to build an Agentic AI application. There are many ways to achieve this via different LLM models and SDKs. We need to select which works the best for us. 

Here I am going to use:
- GitHub Models (free for all)
- Azure AI Foundry Models (paid)
<!-- - Local Models (running locally with GPU) -->

## Prerequisites
- GitHub Account - This is a free option with Codespace to quickly spin up the developer environment. 
- Local development with Visual Studio Code and Python runtime in Windows or in Linux (Ubuntu or remote server).
